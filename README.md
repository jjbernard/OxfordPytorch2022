# OxfordPytorch2022

Course repository for the 2022 version of my course at the University of Oxford

**WARNING**: The code has proven **NOT** to work with Python 3.10, potentially due to incompatible libraries for pytorch. I used Python 3.9 which works fine. 

## Seting-up the environment

Run the following commands:
```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ pip install --upgrade pip
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the notebooks

From the same directory, simply do:
```
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ jupyter-notebook
```

You should be redirected to your browser from which you will be able to see and run the different notebooks
